This project involved creating a creative platformer game with an interdisciplinary team of 5 over the course of four weeks. Our game follows a melodica player protagonist who is mocked for not playing a 'real instrument'. The story follows our protagonist as they travere a dream-esque world, where they must solve music-based puzzles and fight their inner demons.\n\nFor this project, I worked primarily as a 2D artist and sound designer, but also helped as a backup programmer.",
