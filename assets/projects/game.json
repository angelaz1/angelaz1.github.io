This project involved taking the original buggy game from last year (which encountered many setbacks due to COVID), and turning it into a complete and fun experience.\n\n We worked in a large interdisciplinary team over the course of the entire semster. For this project, I worked primarily as a programmer for the CPU buggies, items, and UI.",

One mainstream example of this is OK Go's \"The Writing's On the Wall\" music video. We chose this theme for our game in order to fully utilize the HTC Vive's capabilities of capturing the player's position and orientation.\n\n This game was built with an interdisciplinary team of 5 over the course of two weeks. My main roles in this project were designing the puzzles and creating the 3D/2D art assets.",
