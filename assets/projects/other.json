Over the course of a semester, I designed, modeled, textured, rigged, and animated Shabu, a hotpot character residing in a snowy forest. The final result was a 30-second animated short of our character. This was my first time extensively workinng with Maya on a full character animation (my previous work with 3D animation have been very basic), and I really enjoyed the class!",
